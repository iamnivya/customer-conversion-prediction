# customer-conversion-prediction
## Problem Statement
Model prediction - We do have a E-commerce dataset, we need to identify or predict who are all coming as visitors and converted as out customers.
Recommandation system - we have to show recommanded movie if we enter any movie.
NLP - we have do stemming, lemmatization and sentiment analysis on the text.
Image Processing -  we have to image pre processing like brightened the image, blur the image, edge detection and extract the text from image
